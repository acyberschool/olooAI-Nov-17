# olooAI: Investor Pitch Deck
**The Voice-Native Business Operating System**

---

## Slide 1: The Hook
**Title:** olooAI
**Tagline:** Stop managing software. Start managing your business.
**One-Liner:** The first AI Operating System that builds your CRM, manages your tasks, and creates your marketing content just by listening to you.

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**The "Admin Tax" is killing SMEs.**

Small business owners and founders didn't start companies to become data entry clerks. Yet, they spend **65% of their time** on "work about work":
*   Entering data into rigid CRMs.
*   Clicking through 15 tabs to create one invoice.
*   Struggling to write social media captions.
*   Forgetting follow-ups because logging them is too slow.

**The Result:** Information chaos, lost revenue, and founder burnout. Existing tools (Salesforce, Monday, HubSpot) are built for *reporting*, not for *doing*.

---

## Slide 3: The Solution
**olooAI: The "Do It For Me" Interface.**

olooAI is not another form-based tool. It is a **Voice-First Intelligence Layer** that sits on top of your business data.

*   **Don't click menus.** Just tell Walter (our AI Agent).
*   **Don't fill forms.** Paste an email, and Walter extracts the data.
*   **Don't write drafts.** Tell Walter the goal, and he generates the assets.

It transforms unstructured intent (voice/text) into structured business actions instantly.

---

## Slide 4: Product Demo (The "Magic" Moment)

**Scenario:** A user is driving and has an idea.

**User Says:**
> *"Remind me to call John from Acme Corp tomorrow about the renewal. Create a deal for $50k, and draft a LinkedIn post announcing our new partnership."*

**Walter (AI) Executes:**
1.  **Context Awareness:** Identifies "Acme Corp" in the database.
2.  **Action 1:** Creates a **Task** linked to the client, due tomorrow.
3.  **Action 2:** Creates a **Deal** in the Pipeline valued at $50k.
4.  **Action 3:** Generates a **Social Media Post** (Image + Copy) ready for review.

**Time taken:** 8 seconds.
**Clicks:** 0.

---

## Slide 5: Under the Hood (Tech Stack)

We utilize a thick-client, serverless architecture powered by the latest **Google Gemini 2.5** models.

1.  **The Router Brain (Gemini 2.5 Flash):** A proprietary intent-classification engine that maps natural language to database schema. It knows the difference between a "Task," a "CRM Note," and a "Strategic Question."
2.  **Real-Time Voice (Gemini Live API):** Low-latency WebSocket connection allowing interruptible, human-like conversation.
3.  **Generative Engine:**
    *   **Video:** Veo 3.1 for marketing assets.
    *   **Images:** Nano Banana for social content.
4.  **Multi-Tenant Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Row Level Security (RLS) for enterprise-grade data isolation.

---

## Slide 6: The Market Opportunity

**Target:** The "Prosumer" & SME Market (1-50 employees).

*   **The Shift:** We are moving from **SaaS** (Software as a Service) to **SaaS 2.0** (Service as a Software).
*   **TAM (Total Addressable Market):** The Global CRM & Project Management market is **$65B+**, but the *unserved* market of users who refuse to use complex CRMs is massive.
*   **Why Now?** LLMs finally allow software to understand vague human instructions. The interface barrier is gone.

---

## Slide 7: Business Model

**Freemium SaaS Model**

1.  **Solo (Free):** Basic task management & voice notes. Limited AI calls.
2.  **Pro ($29/mo):** Unlimited Voice, CRM, Content Generation (Image/Video), Advanced Sales Coaching.
3.  **Team ($19/user/mo):** Shared Workspace, Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), Team collaboration features.

**Unit Economics:** High margin. API costs decrease as we optimize context windows and cache frequent queries.

---

## Slide 8: Competitive Landscape

| Feature | Traditional CRM (HubSpot/Salesforce) | AI Wrappers (Chatbots) | **olooAI** |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Input Method** | Forms & Clicks (High Friction) | Chat Text (Medium Friction) | **Voice & Streaming (Zero Friction)** |
| **Structure** | Rigid Database | Unstructured Chat | **Structured Database + Fluid Input** |
| **Capabilities** | Record Keeping | Q&A | **Execution & Creation** |
| **Multi-Modal** | No | Text Only | **Text, Audio, Image, Video** |

**Our Moat:** The "Router Brain" logic. We don't just chat; we *manipulate the database* accurately based on vague context.
