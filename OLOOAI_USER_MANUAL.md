# olooAI User Manual: New Features

Welcome to **olooAI 2.1**. This update introduces powerful collaboration and automation tools designed to make Walter your proactive partner.

---

## 1. DTW (Delegate to Walter)
You will see **"DTW"** buttons across the platform (e.g., "Delegate Day Plan", "Generate Strategy").

**What is it?**
Instead of just recording data, DTW buttons trigger Walter to **think and act**.
*   **Example:** Clicking "Generate Themes" in the Events tab doesn't just open a form. Walter scans industry trends and instantly creates 3 strategic event themes for you to choose from.

**How to use:**
1.  Look for the **Magic Wand Icon** 🪄.
2.  Click the button.
3.  Walter will execute the complex task in the background and notify you when done.

## 2. ATC (Assign to Colleague)
You can now assign work to your team directly through natural language.

**How to use:**
In the voice recorder or text input, simply say:
> *"Create a task to update the slide deck and assign to @John."*

**Walter's Logic:**
1.  Walter detects the **"@"** symbol or the phrase **"assign to"**.
2.  He searches your **Members & Access** list for "John".
3.  He creates the task and automatically tags John as the owner.

---

## 3. Action Cascading
Walter is no longer a "one command, one action" bot. He thinks ahead.

**Try this:**
> *"Onboard new client Acme Corp."*

**Walter will:**
1.  Create the Client "Acme Corp".
2.  **PLUS:** Automatically schedule a "Send Welcome Email" task.
3.  **PLUS:** Create a "Setup Billing" task due in 2 days.

You give the goal; Walter builds the plan.

---

## 4. Managing Your Team
Navigate to **Members & Access** in the sidebar.

*   **Invite:** Type an email to send a Magic Link invite.
*   **Permissions:** Uncheck modules (e.g., "HR", "Sales") to restrict what the new user can see.
*   **Activity:** See exactly when your team members were last active on the platform.
